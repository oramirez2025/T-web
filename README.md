# Description
Welcome to our website protype!
Currently, the website is able to direct you to other pages, such as the sign-up page, where a user can create an account, and the selection page, where the user can view our products. The sign-up and log-in feature hasn't been fully implemented, but the database has been set up with the help of SQLAlchemy. The dabatase will store the user's email and password as a userInfo class.

# Status 
Unfortunately, the website is missing vital features, such as a checkout page, log-in functionality, and beautification, but those will be the next steps in the website. 
Thank you for reading!
